The all-in-one marketing add-on for WooCommerce users.
Design, send and track automatic emails and text messages for customer communications.

== Description ==

> <strong>Why is email marketing so important for WooCommerce users?</strong><br>
> WooCommerce includes limited confirmation email functionality, however these emails are not easily modified or monitored. Use the Sendinblue add-on to deploy effective email and SMS campaigns, improve email deliverability, and track detailed metrics including delivery, open and click rates. 

= TRANSACTIONAL MESSAGING = 
= Confirmation Emails - Design =
Use the Sendinblue add-on to populate WooCommerce order variables directly within your Sendinblue email templates. Sendinblue's responsive design tools make it easy to create email templates that are engaging and include the most important order details.
= Confirmation Emails - Delivery =
The Sendinblue add-on allows you to use professional SMTP to send your WooCommerce confirmation emails. Optimized deliverability ensures your confirmation emails reach the inbox. 

= Confirmation Emails - Reporting =
Get up-to-the-minute analytics on your message deliverability and engagement metrics. Choose a custom time period and review statistics for each email template (order receipt, shipping confirmation, etc.) including the number of emails sent, and delivery, open and click rates. Additional detailed reporting is accessible within the Sendinblue online account dashboard. 

= Confirmation Text Messages =
Text messages (SMS) are powerful relationship building tools. The Sendinblue add-on allows you to send confirmation SMS triggered by specific events in your customer’s order life cycle, such as order confirmation, order shipment and order delivery. Customize messages with your customer’s first name, last name, order price or order date. Full SMS reporting is available within the Sendinblue online account dashboard. 


= MARKETING CAMPAIGNS = 

= Subscription Options =
You can choose whether to display an opt-in field on checkout. If enabled, opt-in customers will be added to the selected list after order creation or order completion. Customize opt-in settings, such as the opt-in field description (e.g. “Send me monthly updates and deals!”) and whether the checkbox is checked by default. You can also activate the "Double Opt-in" feature to invite customers to confirm their subscription by clicking a link in an automated email. 

= SMS & Email Campaigns =
You can send a SMS message directly from WooCommerce settings to all of your customers or all of your subscribers. You can personalize the SMS with dynamic information and test your campaign by sending a test SMS. Please login to your Sendinblue online account dashboard to send email campaigns. 


= FULL FEATURE LIST =
* Send confirmation emails with optimized deliverability
* Use WooCommerce order variables directly within your Sendinblue email templates
* Monitor the most important email metrics: delivery, open and click rates
* Enable and manage customer subscriptions: opt-out, opt-in or double opt-in after order creation or completion
