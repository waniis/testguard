== Description ==

**Complete Migration Plugin for WP professionals**

The only migration tool you will ever need as a professional WordPress developer.
WP Synchro was created to be the migration plugin for developers, with a need to do customized migrations or just full migrations.
You need it done in a fast and easy way, that can be re-run very quickly without any further manual steps, like after a code update.
You can fully customize which database tables you want to move and in PRO version, which files/dirs you want to migrate.

A classic task that WP Synchro will handle for you, is keeping a local development site synchronized with a production site or a staging site in sync with a production site.
You can also push data from your staging or local development enviornment to your production site.

**WP Synchro FREE gives you:**

*   Pull/push database from one site to another site
*   Search/replace in database data (supports serialized data ofc)
*   Handles migration of database table prefixes between sites
*   Select the specific database tables you want to move or just move all
*   Clear cache after migration for popular cache plugins
*   High security - No other sites and servers are involved and all data is encrypted on transfer
*   Setup once - Run multiple times - Perfect for development/staging/production environments

**In addition to this, the PRO version gives you:**

*   File synchronization (such as media, plugins, themes or custom files/dirs)
*   Only synchronize the difference in files, making it super fast
*   Serves a user confirmation on the added/changed/deleted files, before doing any changes
*   Customize the exact synchronization you need - Down to a single file
*   Support for basic authentication (.htaccess username/password)
*   Notification email on success or failure to a list of emails
*   Database backup before migration
*   WP CLI command to schedule synchronizations via cron or other trigger
*   Pretty much the ultimate tool for doing WordPress migrations
*   14 day trial is waiting for you to get started at [WPSynchro.com](https://wpsynchro.com/ "WP Synchro PRO")

**Typical use for WP Synchro:**

 *  Developing websites on local server and wanting to push a website to a live server or staging server
 *  Get a copy of a working production site, with both database and files, to a staging or local site for debugging or development with real data
 *  Generally moving WordPress sites from one place to another, even on a firewalled local network

= 1.7.0 =
 * Improvement: When doing file synchronization, make it an option to show a confirmation dialog to the user before continuing, so the user can verify the which files will be added/changed and deleted
                In this release, it is not turned on by default, since it is a new feature. But it can enabled by setting preconfigured migration to custom synchronization and enabling it under 'File synchronization'
                It is expected to be enabled by default on the preconfigured migrations in one of the next releases
 * Improvement: License key for PRO version can now be saved in code, as a PHP constant. Define the constant WPSYNCHRO_LICENSE_KEY in wp-config.php or the likes, which will override database value
                Example in wp-config.php: define('WPSYNCHRO_LICENSE_KEY', "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX");
 * Improvement: Ask users for acceptance to send data to wpsynchro.com about the usage of features - No personal data ofc.
                The data sent can always be seen in synchronization logs, for full transparency.

 * Improvement: Added better help to the add installation page, to help users understand what the fields are for and where to get the data needed
 * Bug: When syncing mu-plugins, make sure to do the mu-plugin files last, to make sure dependencies are there
 * Bug: Make sure to migrate user.ini and .htaccess files at the very end, to prevent dependency errors, like loading WAF files etc.
 * Bug: When populating files, do a file_exists just before getting data on it, to prevent problems with files that are created when indexing, but removed when we collect data on it
